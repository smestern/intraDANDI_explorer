    "In my second year of undergrad, I took a cellular neurophysiology course knowing nothing about the topic or field. This course blew me away; the idea that you could record directly from single neurons and 'see' their inner workings was (and still is) incredible to me. This inspired what is now a almost a decade long academic journey, one where I learned the ups and downs of patch-clamp electrophysiology. \n",
