                    Description: We used Patch-seq to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing of over 1300 neurons in adult mouse motor cortex, providing a comprehensive morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. Contained in this dandiset are the intracellular electrophysiological recordings. See Dandiset #35 for an additional dataset, recorded under the physiological temperature.
